# Lucinda

(The name is short for "lucene powered file indexa". And it's a woman's name because women just find everything)

A program to index, store and retrieve files in many formats.
Uses [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/), [Apache Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) and Apache Lucene for indexing and retrieving files. Uses [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF) for OCR on PDFs without text layer.
