# Lucinda

(The name is short for "lucene powered file indexa". And it's a woman's name because women just find everything)

A program to index, store and retrieve files in many formats.
Uses Apache Tika and Apache Lucene for indexing and retrieving files.

This repository consists of the lucinda-server, and a generic client library.

You should be able to build all with `mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`


Note: The Elexis plugin using lucinda is moved to [Elexis ungrad](https://github.com/rgwch/elexis-ungrad)
