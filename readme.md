# Lucinda

(The name is short for "lucene powered file indexa". And it's a woman's name because women just find everything)

A program to index, store and retrieve files in many formats.
Uses Apache Tika and Apache Lucene for indexing and retrieving files.

This repository consists of the lucinda-server, a generic client library, an [Elexis](http://github.com/elexis) Plugin using this library, and a [P2 site](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2) to install the plugin in to a running Elexis instance.
